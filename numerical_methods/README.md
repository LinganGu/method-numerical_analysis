Numerical methods are mathematical tools designed to solve numerical problems.

The code was created by Thiago Ney Evaristo Rodrigues.

The theory, list and sequence of methods was based on the book "Numerical Methods for Engineers" by Steven C. Chapra and Raymond P. Canale (McGraw-Hill Education).
