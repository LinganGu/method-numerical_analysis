Solving partial differential equation with non-linear boundary conditions using the numerical method of lines.

The code was created by Thiago Ney Evaristo Rodrigues.

The equation was obtained from the article:
Cotta, R.M., Naveira-Cotta, C.P. and Knupp, D.C. (2016), "Nonlinear eigenvalue problem in the integral transforms solution of convection-diffusion with nonlinear boundary conditions", International Journal of Numerical Methods for Heat & Fluid Flow, Vol. 26 No. 3/4, pp. 767-789.
